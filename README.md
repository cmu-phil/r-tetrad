# r-tetrad

We are working on a new wrapping of the algorihtms in the Tetrad project, https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad, using R-Java. The idea is to remove the need for the user to install anything R, so the user will not need to install Python or Java. The jars for the Java JDK used and the Tetrad jar used will be downloaded programmatically from the web and configured for use in the project.

Initial code has been done for some algorithms as of 2024-09-05.
